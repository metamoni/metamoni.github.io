    <h1>About A11y on Rails </h1>
  
    <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Monica, a full-stack developer with experience in accessibility. I created A11y on Rails because I wanted to write down what I've learned and share it with other developers who are interested in improving the accessibility of their Rails apps.</p>
  
    <p>You probably noticed that this website looks pretty basic. That's because, for now, my aim is to focus more on the content and less on the design. Everything you see here is work in progress. I'll be adding more topics (including links, buttons, accessibility testing, and ARIA) soon.</p>
  
    <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:johndoe@emailaddress.com">send me an email<span class="sr-only"> (opens in new window)</span></a> if you spot any issues, have questions or suggestions, or if you'd just like to say hello!</p>
