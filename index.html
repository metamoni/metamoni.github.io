      <p>In most traditional web apps you can achieve a reasonable level of accessibility with semantic HTML and a good page structure. Rails apps are no different. The framework provides lots of handy Action View Helpers and they come with everything you need to make your app accessible. However, just like when writing plain HTML, it's easy enough to forget about crucial attributes and end up with a page that is not accessible.</p>

      <p>This website aims to tackle some of the most important accessibility concerns, so you can get the basics right in your Rails application. You can read more about the project <a href="./pages/about.html">here</a>.</p>

          <h2>Form validation</h2>
          <p>Custom validation errors are usually skipped by screen readers, unless we explicitly expose them.
